HISTORY OF THE CAESAR CIPHER ----------------------------------------

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as a Caesar's cipher, 
the shift cipher, Caesar's Code or Caesar Shift, is one of the simplest 
and most widely-known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution 
cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some 
fixed number of positions further down the alphabet. For example, with a 
shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. 
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate 
with his generals.

The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated 
as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still 
has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single alphabet 
substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in practice 
offers essentially no communication security.
